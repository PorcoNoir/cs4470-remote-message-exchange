OPTIONS:
help
   Display information about the available user interface options or command manual.

myip
   Display the IP address of this process.
   Note: The IP should not be your “Local” address (127.0.0.1). It should be the actual IP of the computer.

myport
   Display the port on which this process is listening for incoming connections.

connect <destination> <port no>
   This command establishes a new TCP connection to the specified <destination> at the specified <port no>.
   The <destination> is the IP address of the computer. Any attempt to connect to an invalid IP should be 
   rejected and a suitable error message should be displayed. Success or failure in connections between 
   two peers should be indicated by both the peers using suitable messages.
   Self-connections and duplicate connections should be flagged with suitable error messages.

list
   Display a numbered list of all the connections this process is part of. This list includes connections 
   initiated by this process and connections initiated by other processes. The output should display the 
   IP address and the listening port of all the peers the process is connected to.
   Example:
   id: IP address       Port No.
   1:  192.168.21.21    4545
   2:  192.168.21.22    5454
   3:  192.168.21.23    5000
   4:  192.168.21.24    5000

terminate <connection id>
   This command terminates the connection listed under the specified number when LIST is used to display 
   all connections. Example: terminate 2. In this example, the connection with 192.168.21.22 should end. 
   An error message is displayed if a valid connection does not exist as number 2. If a remote machine 
   terminates one of your connections, you should also display a message.

send <connection id> <message>
   (For example, send 3 "Oh! This project is a piece of cake"). This sends the message to the host on the 
   connection designated by the number 3 when the "list" command is used. The message can be up to 100 
   characters long, including spaces. After executing the command, the sender should display “Message 
   sent to <connection id>” on the screen. On receiving a message, the receiver should display the message 
   along with the sender's information.
   Example:
   Message received from 192.168.21.21
   Sender’s Port: <Port number of the sender>
   Message: “<received message>”

exit
   Close all connections and terminate this process. The other peers should also update their connection 
   list by removing the peer that exits.
